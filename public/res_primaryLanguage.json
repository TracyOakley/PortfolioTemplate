      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tracy Oakley. I have just completed a Software Developer Bootcamp from Code Fellows that focused on the MERN stack. And before that I was a US Naval Officer aboard the USS Nevada. I have transitioned my skills in project management and problem solving from the Navy to the software development domain. My interest in software began when I was in college, but when I was in the Navy, I got to create work packages. Work packages are like software projects as they require precise syntax, logic and complex coordination and these experiences with their many review and tests cycles, I found I really enjoyed. I have found even more enjoyment in building coding projects and bringing them to life. Hoping to find a role that deals with feature creation and products to improve user experience or gain exposure in refactoring legacy code bases.",
